# NLP Web App

## Overview
This is a Flask-based NLP web application that implements **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using **spaCy** and Many more yet to implement. The application allows users to register, log in, and extract named entities from the text.

## Features
- User authentication (Registration & Login)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) using **spaCy**
- Web-based UI using Flask & Jinja2 templates
- JSON-based user storage (No SQL database required)

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Flask
- **NLP Library:** spaCy
- **Frontend:** Jinja2, HTML, CSS
- **Storage:** JSON-based user database

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.8). Then, install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

1. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5050/` in your browser.
